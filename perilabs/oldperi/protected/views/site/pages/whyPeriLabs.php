			<h1>Why Peri Labs</h1>
			<p>Researchers generate a lot of data that needs to be well organized. If your coworkers can&rsquo;t find your data, they can&rsquo;t use your data. Peri Labs does all the work of documenting your experiment and storing your results so you donâ€™t have to worry about it. Spend your time in discovery and innovation and less time storing data.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Protect your Intellectual Property</li>
				<li>Gain insight with access to the right information</li>
				<li>Share results with collaborators and reviewers</li>
				<li>Improve productivity and collaboration</li>
				<li>Secure platform for data storage</li>
				<li>Scalable to terabytes of data</li>
			</ul>

			<p>When you can see the whole history of experimentation you can see where you have been and where you are going. And knowing where you are going with your research is the whole point.</p>

			<p>Organize your whole research team with Peri Labs and track experiments as they happen. Never spend time searching for experiments again. <?php echo CHtml::link("Want to see how it works?", array('site/page', 'view'=>'howitworks')) ?></p>
