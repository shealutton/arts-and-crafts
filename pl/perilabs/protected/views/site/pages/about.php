			<h1>About Peri Labs</h1>
			<p>The idea for Peri Labs was born when several researchers needed to organize and share their research. It was hard to know what other people had done or how they solved past problems. We ended up duplicating research and wasting a lot of time. No decent tools seemed to exist to help us solve this problem. After thinking about the idea for a good while, Peri Labs was born.</p>
	
			<p>Our goal is to improve research globally. Itâ€™s a lofty ambition, but a good one. Research and experimentation drive innovation and innovation improves lives. We are firmly committed to helping researchers and there is a special place in our hearts for students and educators. Peri Labs has special programs for educators. <a href="mailto:sales@perilabs.com">Email us to find out more details.</a></p>
